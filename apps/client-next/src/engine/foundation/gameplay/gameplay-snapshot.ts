gameplay-snapshot.ts - the shared rule for partial gameplay publications

The worker coalesces queued snapshots and presentation applies delivered
ones. Both retain the same three omitted fields; every other field comes
only from the newest snapshot. This pure helper owns no state or indexes.

mergeGameplaySnapshots

An omitted shop retains its previous value; an explicitly undefined shop
closes it. Preserve that distinction even when neither input names a shop:
the merged publication may follow a shop delivered in an earlier batch.
The caller discards previous at a world reset. Presentation alone rebuilds
the derived skill index after merging.
